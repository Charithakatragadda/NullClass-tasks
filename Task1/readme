This project was focused on visualizing activation maps to understand which image regions activate CNN filters during the age detection process. The idea was to dive deeper into the inner workings of the model and see exactly what features it considers important when predicting someone's age.
I used a custom pre-trained CNN model to generate these visualizations, which gave me insights into whether the model was focusing on meaningful regions like facial features or being distracted by irrelevant areas. It was pretty interesting to see how the network "sees" an image. I didn't include a GUI since the primary goal was backend analysis and plotting the activation maps for better interpretation.
