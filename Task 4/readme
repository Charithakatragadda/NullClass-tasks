This project involved developing a real-time age detection system specifically designed for a horror roller coaster environment. The primary objective was to ensure age-based safety compliance by detecting the age and gender of individuals in a live video or webcam feed. If the detected age was below 13 or above 60, the system displayed a “Not allowed” message and marked the person with a red rectangle to visually indicate the restriction.
I created a custom machine learning model for this task to achieve accurate real-time predictions. Beyond detection, the system also logged essential details, such as age, gender, and the entry time of each person, into an Excel or CSV file for record-keeping. While a GUI wasn't mandatory, the solution was designed to prioritize smooth performance and functionality, ensuring scalability and reliability in a high-traffic environment like a theme park attraction. This task gave me hands-on experience in real-time machine learning applications and emphasized safety-compliant solutions in public environments.
