This project focused on building a machine learning model for real-time senior citizen identification in a mall or local store setting. The objective was to detect the age and gender of multiple people simultaneously from a live video or webcam feed. If an individual's age was detected as over 60, they were marked as a senior citizen, and their gender was recorded.
To ensure accurate record-keeping, the system stored the detected age, gender, and time of visit in an Excel or CSV file. I developed a custom machine learning model for this task, emphasizing efficient multi-person detection in dynamic environments. Although a GUI was optional, the solution was designed to handle real-time predictions smoothly. This task provided practical experience in integrating machine learning with real-world scenarios where accurate data collection and identification are essential for operational efficiency and personalized customer experiences.
